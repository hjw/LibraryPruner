This is a small gui app to help manage a deeply nested audio library.

Functionally it assumes that the library is set up with category 
directories containing language directories containing mp3 files 
for that language.  In our case category = course type.

Once the desired categories and their respective languages have been
selected the program creates softlinks in a publicly mounted directory
which is what you point your sonos system at.
